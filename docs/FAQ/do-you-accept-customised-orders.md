# Do you accept customised orders?

::: tip ðŸ‘‰ ANSWER
Well, it depends on the order. Mainly we don't accept big specific jobs, but we do do small jobs like making a small graphic interface in HTML, a simple script on animations or so on. Of course, the work we will do will be for a previously agreed amount of money.
