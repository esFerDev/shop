# Using the [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net)

Our scripts use FiveM's Escrow System to be protected against any kind of leak, as well as allowing a much easier system for transferring updates and so on than with any other type of system.
After purchasing the resource on [our website](https://esferdev.tebex.io/), you will receive an email informing you that the script license is already in your hands. As indicated on the purchase receipt, you can download the resource from the [FiveM Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net).

However, to install the script you will need to log in to FiveM Keymaster, and then go to the `Granted Assets` section. There you can find your purchased assets.

## Transfer the asset to another account

This action can only be done once. The user who receives the asset will not be able to transfer it back to another player and therefore the asset will remain permanently on that account.
