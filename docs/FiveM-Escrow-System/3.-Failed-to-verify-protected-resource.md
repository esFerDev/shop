::: tip ✅ SOLUTION
Your server artifacts may be outdated. Update your server to a newer version ([Windows](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) or [Linux](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_proot_linux/master/)).

::: tip ✅ SOLUTION
Files were possibly corrupted during transfer. Ensure hidden files are copied; the .fxap file in a protected resource must be included. Some FTP programs skip these files. You can try using [winscp](https://winscp.net/eng/download.php) to transfer the files to your server.
